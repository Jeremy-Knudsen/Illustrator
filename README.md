## Overview

This is my personal collection of Illustrator scripts, actions, preferences, and other collateral that enhance or streamline my design workflow.

## Examples

TODO: Show what items in my collection do as concisely as possible by way of examples, so that designers can figure out **how** these things might solve their problem.

## Motivation

My motivation is to get as close as I can to "one step to done". This project exists to make my work life easier by making repetitive tasks simple and faster to complete. Feel free to use anything in my collection that might enhance and streamline your own design workflow and please, do share your own and I'll add you to the list of contributors.

## Usage and installation

You can run any script in Illustrator by clicking on "File > Scripts > Other Script..." ( The keyboard shortcut is: "Ctrl + F12" ), and then locate the script file you want to run in the Open dialog window. However, if you want quick access to a particular script in the "File > Scripts" menu, you can copy the script file to the following folder:

Windows
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CC 2017\Presets\en_US\Scripts
