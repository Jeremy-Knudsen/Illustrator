## Overview

This is the workspace layout I prefer to use in Illustrator.

## Examples

TODO: Add a screenshot

## Motivation

A lot of times I have to flatten my PC and set up everything form scratch. Since Adobe doesn't roam the saved workspaces I've created with my Creative Cloud account, I'm forced to re-create it. 

## Usage and installation

Place this file in the following location:

**Windows**
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 21 Settings\en_US\x64\Workspaces
