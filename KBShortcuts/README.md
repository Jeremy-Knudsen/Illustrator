## Overview

Just a few keyboard overrides.

## Examples

TODO: Add a screenshot

## Motivation

A lot of times I have to flatten my PC and set up everything form scratch. Since Adobe doesn't roam the saved keyboard shortcuts that I've created, I'm forced to re-create this every time. Not any more. 

## Usage and installation

Place this file in the following location:

**Windows**
%appdata%\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 21 Settings\en_US\x64\
